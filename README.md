# ProGAN: Progressive Growing of GANs for High-Resolution Image Synthesis

> **Simulated Project** — _Python, PyTorch, CUDA, NumPy, Matplotlib_

## Overview
This project implements a **Progressively Growing Generative Adversarial Network (ProGAN)** capable of generating realistic human face images at a resolution of **256×256**. It starts with low-resolution training (64×64) and progressively adds layers to grow the model to higher resolutions, stabilizing training and improving output fidelity.

The goal was to explore methods for **reducing mode collapse**, improving image diversity, and generating visually coherent images, all while working within simulated environments.

## ✨ Key Features
- 📦 **Progressive Layer Expansion** from 64×64 → 128×128 → 256×256
- 🧠 **Spectral Normalization** for stable GAN training
- 🔀 **Custom Loss Functions** and **label smoothing** to improve convergence
- 🔍 **FID score of 18.3**, indicating high-quality generation
- 💥 **≈15% reduction in mode collapse** compared to baseline DCGAN
